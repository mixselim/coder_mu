// DFS
Applications of Depth First Search:
1) For an unweighted graph, DFS traversal of the graph produces the minimum spanning tree and all pair shortest path tree.
2) Detecting cycle in a graph
   A graph has cycle if and only if we see a back edge during DFS. So we can run DFS for the graph and check for back edges.
3) Path Finding
   We can specialize the DFS algorithm to find a path between two given vertices u and z.
4) Topological Sorting
6) Finding Strongly Connected Components of a graph A directed graph is called strongly connected if there is a path from each 
   vertex in the graph to every other vertex.
7) Solving puzzles with only one solution, such as mazes.
